How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To make sure that my code is functional, I test after every new section that I code so that I can see that it does what I intended after looking at client needs. To make sure that the program is secure, I run it after completion and test it to make sure that the testing that was coded into it works and makes sure that the right information is utilized when accessing. 
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The client first provides their requirements, and from that, we can determine what the user needs to be able to do to use the program effectively.
How do I approach designing software?
I first make sure that I clearly understand the client and user needs so that I have a framework to follow when coding. Now I make sure that the requirements that were identified are implemented as I code. After each section, I do static testing just to visually confirm that there are few or no errors in the code. From there, I run the code to see if it works as intended. Now I also include testing in the code to ensure the program runs to certain specifications. Once the code is completed for the entire project, I run it to make sure that it works.
